    <p class="paragraph__title">Beginning</p>
    <p class="paragraph__text">JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, who works at Netscape. At that time, the web was in its infancy, and HTML was the main language for creating web pages. However, HTML did not allow the creation of interactive elements such as buttons, shapes, and animations.</p>

    <p class="paragraph__title">Why such a name?</p>
    <p class="paragraph__text">Brendan Ike created the first prototype of the language, which was originally called Mocha, then renamed Javascript and finally became known as JavaScript. This rapid development process was dictated by the company's desire to quickly enter the market with a new product that could compete with other technologies.</p>
    <p class="paragraph__text">The name JavaScript was chosen for marketing purposes to associate it with the popular Java language at that time. However, Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages. Java was developed by Sun Microsystems and was designed to create complex server-side applications, whereas JavaScript initially focused on the client side of web pages.</p>

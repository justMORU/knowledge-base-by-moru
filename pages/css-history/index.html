<h3>Beginning</h3>
<p><span></span>The history of CSS began in the mid-1990s, when the need to separate the structure and style of web pages became apparent.</p>
<p><span></span>In 1994, Haakon Vium Lee proposed the concept of CSS. He understood that web pages needed a standardized design method that was independent of HTML. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, supported this idea.</p>

<h3>CSS1</h3>
<p><span></span>In December 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published the first CSS specification, known as CS 1. This was the first step towards separating the structure of a web page from its style. CSS1 included basic styles for text, fonts, colors, and alignment.</p>

<h3>CSS2</h3>
<p><span></span>In 1998, the W3C released the CSS2 specification. It has significantly expanded the capabilities of CSS 1 by adding new features and improvements.</p>

<h3>CSS2.1</h3>
<p><span></span>In 2004, the CSS2.1 specification was released. It included bug fixes and improvements, providing a more stable and reliable framework for web design.</p>

<h3>In our time - CSS3</h3>
<p><span></span>In 2011, the CSS3 version was released. It consists of a series of modules, each of which adds new features to the design of web pages. Among them are modules for animation, transformation, gradients, shadows, borders and many other effects.</p>
